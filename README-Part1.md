a. Brief description of work in Part 1:

  For implementing the sample tuples generation, we split up the coding tasks into two parts: I would be responsible for the all of the integer attributes of the relations, and David would be responsible for the three string attributes.

b. Which system we will be working with and why we chose it:

  For our system, we decided to go with PostgreSQL because it was the system that was the most easily accessible for both of us.
  
c. Demonstrate that we have loaded data into the system

d. Lessons or issues we had encountered
